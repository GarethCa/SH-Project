The three-dimensional trajectories of two highly invasive cell lines, the human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and the human MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma, were determined for long-term infiltration in plain or Matrigel-containing collagen type I gels. We modeled the trajectories with a novel formulation of the continuous Markov chain model that can distinguish between the tendencies for infiltration or lateral motion. Parameters such as the speed of subpopulations, the persistence of motion in certain directions, the turning frequency of the cells, the ultimate direction of motion, and the cell distribution with the infiltration depth were obtained to quantify the migration and infiltration at the cellular level. Distinct migratory and infiltration phenotypes were identified for the two cell types that were significantly dependent on gel composition. The HT-1080 cell line expressed a high motility phenotype on the plain collagen gel surface. The Matrigel-containing gel significantly enhanced the infiltration and the turning frequency of the HT-1080 cells. This study shows that tumor cell infiltration and migration are dynamic processes that depend significantly on the cell type and the microenvironment. {\textcopyright}2002 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Abstract We have developed and tested an automated method for simultaneous 3-D tracking of numerous, fluorescently-tagged cells. The procedure uses multiple thresholding to segment individual cells at a starting timepoint, and then iteratively applies a template-matching algorithm to locate a particular cell's position at subsequent timepoints. To speed up the method, we have developed a distributed implementation in which template matching is carried out in parallel on several different server machines. The distributed implementation showed a monotonic decrease in response time with increasing number of servers (up to 15 tested), demonstrating that the tracking algorithm is well suited to parallelization, and that nearly real-time performance could be expected on a parallel processor. Of four different template matching statistics tested for 3-D tracking of amoebae from the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, we found that the automated procedure performed best when using a correlation statistic for matching. Using this statistic, the method achieved a 98.5\% success rate in correctly identifying a cell from one time point to the next. This method is now being used regularly for 3-D tracking of normal and mutant cells of D. discoideum, and as such provides a means to quantify the motion of many cells within a three-dimensional tissue mass.}

abstract = {Summary Analysis of in vitro cell motility is a useful tool for assessing cellular response to a range of factors. However, the majority of cell-tracking systems available are designed primarily for use with fluorescently labelled images. In this paper, five commonly used tracking systems are examined for their performance compared with the use of a novel in-house cell-tracking system based on the principles of image registration and optical flow. Image registration is a tool commonly used in medical imaging to correct for the effects of patient motion during imaging procedures and works well on low-contrast images, such as those found in bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy. The five cell-tracking systems examined were Retrac, a manual tracking system used as the gold standard; CellTrack, a recently released freely downloadable software system that uses a combination of tracking methods; ImageJ, which is a freely available piece of software with a plug-in for automated tracking (MTrack2) and Imaris and Volocity, both commercially available automated tracking systems. All systems were used to track migration of human epithelial cells over ten frames of a phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy sequence. This showed that the in-house image-registration system was the most effective of those tested when tracking non-dividing epithelial cells in low-contrast images, with a successful tracking rate of 95\%. The performance of the tracking systems was also evaluated by tracking fluorescently labelled epithelial cells imaged with both phase-contrast and confocal microscopy techniques. The results showed that using fluorescence microscopy instead of phase contrast does improve the tracking efficiency for each of the tested systems. For the in-house software, this improvement was relatively small (<5\% difference in tracking success rate), whereas much greater improvements in performance were seen when using fluorescence microscopy with Volocity and ImageJ.}

abstract="DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is an important spatial clustering technique that is widely adopted in numerous applications. As the size of datasets is extremely large nowadays, parallel processing of complex data analysis such as DBSCAN becomes indispensable. However, there are three major drawbacks in the existing parallel DBSCAN algorithms. First, they fail to properly balance the load among parallel tasks, especially when data are heavily skewed. Second, the scalability of these algorithms is limited because not all the critical sub-procedures are parallelized. Third, most of them are not primarily designed for shared-nothing environments, which makes them less portable to emerging parallel processing paradigms. In this paper, we present MR-DBSCAN, a scalable DBSCAN algorithm using MapReduce. In our algorithm, all the critical sub-procedures are fully parallelized. As such, there is no performance bottleneck caused by sequential processing. Most importantly, we propose a novel data partitioning method based on computation cost estimation. The objective is to achieve desirable load balancing even in the context of heavily skewed data. Besides, We conduct our evaluation using real large datasets with up to 1.2 billion points. The experiment results well confirm the efficiency and scalability of MR-DBSCAN.",
